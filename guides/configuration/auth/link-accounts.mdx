title: "Link Login Accounts"
---

For users created with Particle Auth, after logging in, they can bind other accounts. Once binding is complete, they can use these accounts to log in to the corresponding same user. Even users created with JWT login can bind other accounts, allowing them to continue using their wallet independently of the project application.

All of our SDKs provide a page for binding other login accounts, which can be called with a single click.
