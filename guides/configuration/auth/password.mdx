title: "Master Password & Payment Password"
---

For Particle Auth users, there are two types of passwords that can be set:

1. Master Password: This is used to encrypt and backup the user's local MPC key shard. Only the user knows this password; Particle does not store it. If the user forgets it, it cannot be recovered.
2. Payment Password: After being set by the user, this password is used for verification before signing. Unlike the master password, the payment password can be turned off and reset by the user at any time.
