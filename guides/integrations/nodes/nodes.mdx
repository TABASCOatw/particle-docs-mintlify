## Leveraging Particle Network RPC Nodes

Particle Network provides free-to-use RPC nodes as a complementary technology to the other components of its tech stack. This RPC is used within the backend of various Particle Network modals and demos, and thus is open to use through any supported network ([Network Coverage](/guides/network-coverage)) and can be used for any standard RPC method available on these chains.

## Benefits of using Particle Network RPC nodes

Particle Network's RPC nodes are built to scale efficiently while retaining low latency and high reliability. These nodes have been reliably used as the core RPC infrastructure backing major campaigns run by Particle Network, some components of Particle Wallet, and other key applications built by Particle Network. Developers leveraging these nodes can be assured that they provide an in-house, reliable, and free mechanism for reading and writing data to every major EVM blockchain, alongside Solana.

## Accessing Particle Network's RPC nodes

To begin building with Particle Network's RPC nodes, head over to the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network). From here, spin up a project and navigate to the **Endpoint** page within the **NODE RPC** section. You'll then be able to choose a specific chain and retrieve an endpoint. 

Below the **Endpoint** page, you can also view statistics regarding the volume of requests you're using, specific method calls, and so on.
