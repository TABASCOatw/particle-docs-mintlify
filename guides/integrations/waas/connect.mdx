Particle Connect takes a middle-ground position within Particle Network's Wallet-as-a-Service tech stack. It sits between Particle Auth (for social logins) and Particle Wallet (as an interaction interface). 

Particle Connect is an **in-house connection modal and component enabling users to connect with dApps through either Web2-based accounts** (through Particle Auth with Google, Twitter, email, phone, etc.) **or Web3-native wallets** (such as MetaMask, Phantom, etc.). Whether a user would like to login through a social account, or through their MetaMask wallet, Particle Connect exists to be the **singular interface facilitating both of these methods of connecting to a dApp**.

In this sense, Particle Connect can be best described as an **SSO for Web3**, offering a strong method of onboarding users **regardless of their comfort level or personal integration within Web3**. This ultimately **lowers the entry barrier within applications** without resulting in a clunky experience for Web3-native users; instead, the experience is standardized across both mediums.
