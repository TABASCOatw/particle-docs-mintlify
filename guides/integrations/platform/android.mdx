## SDKs with Android Support

Particle Network offers **extensive support for Android applications** through SDKs built with Kotlin. 

While the configuration and interaction process deviates somewhat from the standard web SDKs, Android is **actively maintained as a primary platform** across every SDK that Particle offers: **Particle Auth**, **Particle Connect**, **Particle Wallet**, and **Particle's AA SDK**. For each, you can find a comprehensive rundown of the installation, configuration, and utilization process via the cards below.
