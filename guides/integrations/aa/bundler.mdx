## Bundlers within Particle's AA SDK

Particle Network's AA stack is built to be as modular as possible while retaining a central mechanism for managing and sending UserOperations. Thus, the in-house Particle Bundler is used by default when sending UserOperations through the Particle AA SDK ([Introduction to Smart Wallet-as-a-Service](/api-reference/aa/introduction)). However, a core element of Particle's AA SDK is the ability to build a UserOperation and then send it directly through whatever alternative Bundler you prefer.

The below image showcases the different native and external implementations present in Particle's AA SDK.
