title: "Solana wallet-adapter"
---

The official Solana `wallet-adapter` is among the most popular means of facilitating wallet connection within your Solana application. `wallet-adapter`  implements a common wallet standard for generalized extension-based wallet connection. It has also directly integrated various SDK-based wallet solutions, such as Particle Network through the `ParticleAdapter`.

## `ParticleAdapter`

Officially available through `wallet-adapter` is `ParticleAdapter`, a direct port of `@particle-network/solana-wallet`, enabling full stack implementation of Particle's Wallet-as-a-Service natively within your Solana application without the need for external libraries.

`ParticleAdapter` can be imported within applications leveraging `wallet-adapter` through the following:

```typescript
import { ParticleAdapter } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-wallets';
```

This adapter was built to mimic the full extent of the functionality offered within typical implementations of Particle Auth, including exposure of `.auth`, standard configuration, and more. Specifically, `ParticleAdapter` can be configured through the `config` object, as shown below:

```typescript
new ParticleAdapter({
	config: {
  	projectId: process.env.REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID,
  	clientKey: process.env.REACT_APP_CLIENT_KEY,
		appId: process.env.REACT_APP_APP_ID,
	},
});
```

## `wallet-adapter-ext`

While Particle's Wallet-as-a-Service is officially available through `wallet-adapter`, Particle Network also offers a custom adapter through `@particle-network/wallet-adapter-ext`. This adapter is nearly identical to `ParticleAdapter`, with the difference that it allows you to set the adapter to be represented as a social login within the connection menu, rather than just "Particle."

```typescript
import { ParticleAdapter } from '@particle-network/wallet-adapter-ext';

new ParticleAdapter({
	config: {
  	projectId: process.env.REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID,
  	clientKey: process.env.REACT_APP_CLIENT_KEY,
		appId: process.env.REACT_APP_APP_ID,
	},
  // Extended functionality
  preferredAuthType: {
  	type: 'google', setAsDisplay: true
  }
});
```
