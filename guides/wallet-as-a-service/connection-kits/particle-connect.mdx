## Using Particle Network's native connection kit, Particle Connect

Alongside the previously covered connection kits, Particle Network also has a native, in-house connection modal spanning both mobile and desktop platforms: Particle Connect. 

The primary purpose of Particle Connect is to facilitate the seamless unification of Web2-based and Web3-native onboarding mechanisms between social logins and external wallets. With a natural implementation flow built around this unification -tying in directly to Particle Wallet- using Particle Connect presents a simple mechanism for onboarding.
