# Implementing Particle's Modular AA Stack within Web Applications

Although Wallet-as-a-Service extends the flexibility of EOAs, Particle Network recently decided to focus on account abstraction as the primary means of interaction within applications, facilitated by Wallet-as-a-Service. Thus, Particle has recently released its modular AA stack, a collection of technologies and SDKs natively compatible with Wallet-as-a-Service. This release happened alongside any other wallet that exposes an EIP-1193 provider, or any application leveraged account abstraction through alternative means.

Specifically, this stack includes:

- **The Particle Bundler:** Particle Network's in-house, open-source Bundler, responsible for almost 1 million UserOperations.
- **Particle's Omnichain Paymaster:** Facilitates multi-chain USDT-based gas sponsorships from a single deposit.
- **Particle's AA SDKs:** These streamline the implementation of AA  natively with Particle's Wallet-as-a-Service.

Within this page, you'll find a quick rundown on installing, configuring, and using Particle's AA SDK (tying in directly with its Bundler and Paymaster). For information on Particle Network's Modular Smart Wallet-as-a-Service, take a look at [Modular Smart Wallet-as-a-Service](/landing/wallet-abstraction/waas/overview), or if you'd like to dive into the technical details a bit more, head over to [Introduction to Smart Wallet-as-a-Service](/api-reference/aa/introduction).

## Installing and configuring the AA SDK

Particle currently categorizes its various AA SDKs by platform. Thus, for desktop, everything is unified into a single SDK, `@particle-network/aa`.

<Note>The AA SDK is open-source on [Particle Network's GitHub](https://github.com/Particle-Network/aa-sdk).</Note>

As mentioned, the Particle AA SDK can be installed through commands such as:

```shell
npm install @particle-network/aa
```

Or

```shell
yarn add @particle-network/aa
```

Upon installation, you can immediately configure a smart account to use, derived from (owned by) a wallet connected to a provided EIP-1193 provider object. Within this configuration, you'll have the ability to choose between either a Biconomy (`BICONOMY`), CyberConnect (`CYBERCONNECT`), or SimpleAccount (`SIMPLE`) instance. In this same configuration, you'll be able to define the usage of either Particle Network's native Paymaster (will be active if `paymasterApiKeys` is left blank), or Biconomy's paymaster (only active if `paymasterApiKeys` is defined). An example of this configuration is below:

```typescript TypeScript
import { SmartAccount } from '@particle-network/aa';
  
const smartAccount = new SmartAccount(provider, {
    projectId: 'Particle Network project ID',
    clientKey: 'Particle Network client key',
    appId: 'Particle Network app ID',
    aaOptions: {
        accountContracts: {  // 'BICONOMY', 'CYBERCONNECT', 'SIMPLE'
            BICONOMY: [
                {
                    version: '1.0.0',  
                    chainIds: [x, xx],
                },
                {  
                    version: '2.0.0',
                    chainIds: [x, xx],
                }
            ],
            CYBERCONNECT: [
                {
                    version: '1.0.0',
                    chainIds: [x, xx], 
                }
            ],
            SIMPLE: [
                {
                    version: '1.0.0',
                    chainIds: [x, xx],
                }
            ],
        },
        paymasterApiKeys: [{
            chainId: 1,  
            apiKey: 'Biconomy Paymaster API Key',
        }]
    }, 
});

smartAccount.setSmartAccountContract({ name: 'BICONOMY', version: '2.0.0' });
```

From this point, you can either directly construct, sponsor, and send UserOperations (alongside the initialization of session keys and whatnot if you'd like) through the newly initialized `smartAccount` object, or through a traditional Web3 library such as ethers or Web3.js; the latter is done through the construction of an 1193 provider object, `AAWrapProvider`.

```typescript TypeScript
import { AAWrapProvider, SendTransactionMode } from '@particle-network/aa';
import Web3 from "web3";

// .UserPaidNative, .Gasless, or .UserSelect
const wrapProvider = new AAWrapProvider(smartAccount, SendTransactionMode.UserPaidNative); 
const web3 = new Web3(wrapProvider); 
```
