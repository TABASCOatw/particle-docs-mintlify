## Contextualizing `suggestedGasFees`

- `suggestedGasFees` returns an object containing tiered gas fee suggestions under EIP-1559 regulations for a chain derived from a given `chainId`.

It provides gas fee options for low, medium, and fast transaction speeds, complete with estimated wait times and the current base fee. It takes no parameters, although, as usual with Particle's enhanced RPC, it still requires basic authentication.
