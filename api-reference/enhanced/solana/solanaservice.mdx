Alongside the common `EvmService` SDK module, `SolanaService` enables programmatic data retrieval through Particle Network's suite of enhanced RPC endpoints. Specifically, `SolanaService` provides direct access to the endpoints listed on this document and additional SDK-exclusive methods, making it simple to work with rich data on Solana.

A full reference of each common method alongside their parameters can be found **below**.
