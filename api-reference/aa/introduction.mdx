## Simple, full-stack implementation of ERC-4337 account abstraction

Particle Network natively facilitates **end-to-end utilization of ERC-4337 account abstraction** through its Account Abstraction SDK; capable of constructing, sponsoring, and sending UserOperations alongside the deployment of Smart Accounts, fee quote retrieval, and other key functions. At the center of Particle Network's Smart Wallet-as-a-Service is the AA SDK fundamentally powering the interaction between the EOA generated and secured by MPC-TSS and an associated Smart Account.

The Particle Network Account Abstraction SDK acts as a **central mechanism for seamlessly interacting with account abstraction**, either natively with Particle Auth or through an external interface.
