## Particle Connect for Android

Particle Connect enables onboarding through Web2 accounts (via Particle Auth) and various Web3 wallets (via. WalletConnect, Solana's mobile `wallet-adapter`, and key imports). Particle Connect is a custom, in-house connection modal designed to onboard users across different login verticals. In this case, these are Web2 accounts, Web3 wallets, and private key imports. This essentially unlocks universal accessibility within your application, bringing users (Web3-native or not) on-chain.

Implementing Particle Connect as the primary connection mechanism within your Android application only takes a few steps, **which are outlined below**.

## Repository

Before diving into the configuration and utilization process, if you'd like to take a look at the repository for an initial understanding of the underlying architecture and implementation flow, the Particle Connect Android SDK repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Particle-Network/particle-connect-android) (includes demos and examples).

<Warning>
It is strongly discouraged to use a private key or the mnemonic import/generate function. If you use it, you need to secure the data yourself, as Particle doesn't have a relationship with the imported/generated mnemonic or private key.
</Warning>

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Installing and initializing Particle Connect is quite simple. In this case, this can be summed up in three steps. The first of them involves dependency management within your `build.gradle` file. Particle Connect requires numerous dependencies, the extent of which depends on the functions you intend to use within your application. 

To configure these dependencies, open your `build.gradle` file, and either paste the below code or conditionally define dependencies based upon which types of wallets you'd like to support:

1. Regardless of specific functions, you'll need `network.particle:auth-service:{latest-version}` (Particle Auth), `network.particle:connect:{latest-version}` (Particle Connect), alongside either of the following:
   1. `network.particle:connect-auth-adapter:{latest-version}` - This is the standard Particle Auth adapter (very similar to the typical Particle Auth SDK).
   2. `network.particle:connect-auth-core-adapter:{latest-version}` - Alternatively, you can use the Particle Auth Core adapter (very similar to the Particle Auth Core SDK).
2. If you'd like to support importing (or generating fresh) wallets on EVM chains, you'll need `network.particle:connect-evm-adapter:{latest-version}`.
   1. To do the same on Solana, you can use `network.particle:connect-solana-adapter:{latest-version}`.
3. To support connection with Phantom (on Solana), you'll need to use `network.particle:connect-phantom-adapter:{latest-version}`.
4. For a general WalletConnect-based connection, you can use `network.particle:connect-wallet-connect-adapter:{latest-version}`.

```groovy build.gradle
dependencies {
  //required
  modules {
    module("org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15to18") {
      replacedBy("org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on")
    }
    module("org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk18on") {
      replacedBy("org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on")
    }
  }
  implementation 'network.particle:auth-core:{latest-version}'
  implementation 'network.particle:connect:{latest-version}'
  implementation 'network.particle:connect-auth-core-adapter:{latest-version}'
  implementation 'network.particle:connect-evm-adapter:{latest-version}'
  implementation 'network.particle:connect-solana-adapter:{latest-version}'
  implementation 'network.particle:connect-phantom-adapter:{latest-version}'
  implementation 'network.particle:connect-wallet-connect-adapter:{latest-version}'
}
```

### Setting up the Particle dashboard

All implementations of Particle Connect (and Particle Auth) require three universal values: `projectId`, `appId`, and `clientKey`. These values tie a given implementation to the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network/), enabling configuration, analytics, tracking, etc.

<Note>Follow the quickstart tutorial to set up a project and find the required keys: [Create a new project](/guides/wallet-as-a-service/waas/mobile-quickstart#configuring-particle-auth).</Note>

### Configuration

Now that you've set your dependencies and retrieved your `projectId` (`pn_project_id`), `clientKey` (`pn_project_client_key`), and `appId` (`pn_app_id`), from the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network), you'll need to move on to configuring `AndroidManifest.xml` using the previously retrieved values to authenticate your implementation of Particle Connect. 

Open `AndroidManifest.xml` and either paste the below code or add a configuration that looks as the following:

```xml XML
<application>
    <activity
        android:name="com.particle.network.controller.WebActivity"
        android:exported="true"
        android:launchMode="singleTask"
        android:configChanges="orientation|keyboardHidden|screenSize"
        android:theme="@style/ThemeAuthWeb">
        <intent-filter>
            <data android:scheme="pn${pn_app_id}" />

            <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />

            <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
            <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
        </intent-filter>
    </activity>
    
    <activity
        android:name="com.connect.common.controller.RedirectActivity"
        android:exported="true"
        android:launchMode="singleTask"
        android:configChanges="orientation|keyboardHidden|screenSize"
        android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar.Fullscreen">
        <intent-filter>
            <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />

            <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
            <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />

            <data android:scheme="connect${PN_APP_ID}" />
        </intent-filter>
    </activity>
    
    <meta-data
        android:name="particle.network.project_id"
        android:value="${pn_project_id}"/>
    <meta-data
        android:name="particle.network.project_client_key"
        android:value="${pn_project_client_key}"/>
    <meta-data
        android:name="particle.network.app_id"
        android:value="${pn_app_id}"/>
</application>
```

### Initialization

Before jumping into utilization and implementation, you'll need to finish the setup process by initializing Particle Connect within `Application#Create()` (`onCreate()`). Until initialization happens, Particle Connect won't work. This acts as the primary means of configuration. 

Initialization can be started through the `init` method on `ParticleConnect` (from `com.particle.connect.ParticleConnect`). `init` takes the following parameters:

- `this`, operational context (you can keep it set to `this`).
- `Env`, the environment (production, development, etc.) Particle Connect will be initialized within. Imported from `com.particle.base.Env`.
- `ChainInfo`, the primary chain to be used within your application. `ChainInfo` can be set as a `ChainInfo` object imported from `network.particle.chains.ChainInfo.Companion.{chain}`.
- `dAppMetadata`, metadata outlining the description of your application. This should be set as an instance of `DAppMetadata` (imported from `com.particle.base.model.DAppMetadata`) with the following parameters set:
  - `walletConnectProjectId`, your WalletConnect project ID retrieved from the [WalletConnect dashboard](https://cloud.walletconnect.com).
  - `name`, the name of your project.
  - `icon`, a link containing the logo (icon) of your project; this should be 512x512, ideally.
  - `url`, the URL of your project's website.
  - `description`, a short description to be used in representing your project.
- Additionally, within the body of the`init`, you'll need to define a list (`listOf`) wallets (adapters) that you'd like to be provided as an option within your instance of Particle Connect (these can be imported from `com.wallet.connect.adapter.{Adapter name}`).

| Field          | Type                           | Description                                                  |
| :------------- | :----------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| application    | Application                    | Android applicaiton                                          |
| env            | Env                            | DEV, STAGING, PRODUCTION,Different levels display different log information |
| chain          | ChainInfo                      | the primary chain to be used within your application. `ChainInfo` can be set as a `ChainInfo` object imported from `network.particle.chains.ChainInfo.Companion.{chain}`.  such as ChainInfo.Ethereum„ÄÅChainInfo.Solana |
| dAppData       | DAppMetadata                   | metadata outlining the description of your application. This should be set as an instance of `DAppMetadata` (imported from `com.particle.base.model.DAppMetadata`) with the following parameters set:<br /><br />  `walletConnectProjectId`, your WalletConnect project ID retrieved from the [WalletConnect dashboard](https://cloud.walletconnect.com).<br /> `name`, the name of your project. <br />`icon`, a link containing the logo (icon) of your project; this should be 512x512, ideally.<br /> `url`, the URL of your project's website. <br />`description`, a short description to be used in representing your project. |
| createAdapters | (() -> List`<IConnectAdapter>`)? | you'll need to define a list (`listOf`) wallets (adapters) that you'd like to be provided as an option within your instance of Particle Connect (these can be imported from `com.wallet.connect.adapter.{Adapter name}`). |
|                |                                |                                                              |

```kotlin Kotlin
val dAppMetadata = DAppMetadata(
            walletConnectProjectId = "f431aaea6e4dea6a669c0496f9c009c1",
            name ="Particle Connect",
            icon= "https://connect.particle.network/icons/512.png",
            url = "https://particle.network",
            description = "Particle Connect is a decentralized wallet connection solution that allows users to connect to DApps with their wallets.",
            redirect = "redirect://",
            verifyUrl = "verifyUrl",
        )
ParticleConnect.init(
    this,
    Env.DEV,
    ChainInfo.Ethereum,
    dAppMetadata 
) {
    listOf(
        AuthCoreAdapter(),
        MetaMaskConnectAdapter(),
        RainbowConnectAdapter(),
        TrustConnectAdapter(),
        ImTokenConnectAdapter(),
        BitKeepConnectAdapter(),
        OKXConnectAdapter(),
        WalletConnectAdapter(),
        PhantomConnectAdapter(),
        EVMConnectAdapter(),
        SolanaConnectAdapter(),
    )
}.
```

## Examples of utilization

### Switch Chain

To switch the primary chain being used after initial configuration, you'll need to retroactively call `ParticleConnect.setChain`, which takes one parameter, `chain` (should be a `ChainInfo` object imported from `network.particle.chains.ChainInfo.Companion.{chain}`). Upon calling this method, the chain will be switched for the current active session, as is shown below:

```kotlin Kotlin
ParticleConnect.setChain(chain)
```

### Get all Wallet Adapters

If you'd like to retrieve a complete list of current wallet adapters for either `evm` or `solana`you'll need to call `ParticleConnect.getAdapters` while passing in the chain type, either `evm` or `solana`. E.g.:

```kotlin Kotlin
var adapters = ParticleConnect.getAdapters(chainType)
```

### Get all Connected Accounts

For a list of all currently connected accounts/addresses (via Particle Connect), you can call `ParticleConnect.getAccounts` while passing in the type of chain to retrieve active accounts for, either `evm` or `solana`. E.g.:

```kotlin Kotlin
val accounts = ParticleConnect.getAccounts(chainType)
```

### Connect Wallet

Likely one of the most important methods, specific adapters can initiate connection (through an initialization in a variable such as `adapter`) with the `connect`method. Depending on the specific adapter, this method will throw a modal facilitating connection.

For `EVMConnectAdapter` and `SolanaConnectAdapter`, this will generate a fresh account (public and private key pair). Otherwise, the specific connection flow will be dependent upon the adapter in which `connect` is called. E.g.:

| Field    | Type             | Description                                                  |
| :------- | :--------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `config` | `ConnectConifg?` | The `ConnectConfig` will only be effective when `adapter.name` is MobileWCWalletName.AuthCore.name`. You can construct a valid object using the subclass `ParticleAuthCoreConfig`. When `adapter.walletType` is other value, you can pass null. |

`ConnectConfig` ` There are 4 already implemented subclasses that can correspond to different connection scenarios

| **Field**         | **Type**                          | **Description**                                              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| loginType         | LoginType                         | the social login method preferred. This supports either EMAIL, PHONE, TWITTER, GOOGLE, FACEBOOK, APPLE, DISCORD, GITHUB, TWITCH, MICROSOFT, LINKEDIN, JWT. |
| account           | String                            | Default is empty, you can use the `account` parameter to pass in an expected email, phone number, or JWT. This is optional for the former two, but required for `.jwt`. The phone number must be in E.164 format. |
| supportLoginTypes | List`<SupportLoginType>`            | The default setting includes support for all SupportLoginTypes: EMAIL, PHONE, FACEBOOK, GOOGLE, APPLE, TWITTER, DISCORD, GITHUB, TWITCH, MICROSOFT, and LINKEDIN. You can also provide a specific subset of SupportLoginTypes if needed. |
| prompt            | LoginPrompt?                      | the prompt to be displayed following social login, such as a request to set a master password, payment password, etc. This is `null` by default. |
| loginPageConfig   | LoginPageConfig?                  | If you use a Google to log in, you can control the Google account login prompt with this parameter: None„ÄÅConsent or SelectAccount. |
| loginCallback     | AuthCoreServiceCallback`<UserInfo>` | success : wiil return UserInfo. <br /><br />failure : will return a ErrorInfo |

```kotlin Kotlin

data class ConnectConfigJWT(
    val jwt: String,
) : ConnectConfig

data class ConnectConfigEmail(
    @SerializedName("email") val email: String = "",
    @SerializedName("code") val code: String = "",
    @SerializedName("supportLoginTypes") val supportLoginTypes: List`<SupportLoginType>` = SupportLoginType.values().toList(),
    @SerializedName("prompt") val prompt: LoginPrompt? = null,
    @SerializedName("loginPageConfig") val loginPageConfig: LoginPageConfig? = null,
) : ConnectConfig

data class ConnectConfigPhone(
    @SerializedName("phone") val phone: String = "",
    @SerializedName("code") val code: String = "",
    @SerializedName("supportLoginTypes") val supportLoginTypes: List`<SupportLoginType>` = SupportLoginType.values().toList(),
    @SerializedName("prompt") val prompt: LoginPrompt? = null,
    @SerializedName("loginPageConfig") val loginPageConfig: LoginPageConfig? = null,
) : ConnectConfig

data class ConnectConfigSocialLogin(
    @SerializedName("loginType") val loginType: SocialLoginType,
    @SerializedName("prompt") val prompt: LoginPrompt? = null,
) : ConnectConfig

//jwt connect 
val adapter = ParticleConnect.getAdapters().first { it is AuthCoreAdapter } 
val connectConfigJWT = ConnectConfigJWT(jwt = "your jwt")
adapter.connect(connectConfigJWT, object : ConnectCallback {
  override fun onConnected(account: Account) {
      val publicAddress =  account.publicAddress
  }
  override fun onError(error: ConnectError) {
     //handle error
  }
})
//social connect 
val connectConfigSocialLogin =  ConnectConfigSocialLogin(loginType = SocialLoginType.GOOGLE, prompt = LoginPrompt.SelectAccount)
adapter.connect(connectConfigSocialLogin,callback)

//email connect
val connectConfigEmail = ConnectConfigEmail()
adapter.connect(connectConfigEmail, callback)

//phone connect
val connectConfigPhone =ConnectConfigPhone()
adapter.connect(connectConfigPhone, callback)
```

### Disconnect Wallet

To programmatically force an account to disconnect from your application, you'll need to call `connectAdapter.disconnect`, with `connectAdapter` referring to an instance of a given wallet adapter. This takes one parameter (other than the callback), `address`, in which you can specify the address to disconnect. An example of this has been included below. E.g.:

```kotlin Kotlin
connectAdapter.disconnect(address, callback) 
```

### Is Connected

In the fairly common cases where you need to know whether or not a given account is connected, you can use `connectAdapter.connected`, passing in a targeted address. E.g.:

```kotlin Kotlin
val result = connectAdapter.connected(address)
```

### Import & Export Wallet

If you're using an instance of either `EVMConnectAdapter` or `SolanaConnectAdapter`, in your definition of `connectAdapter`, you can import a wallet from either a private key or mnemonic (seed phrase). This can be done through either `connectAdapter.importWalletFromPrivateKey` or `connectAdapter.importWalletFromMnemonic`, both of which will return an account structure to be used.

Additionally, you can export one of these wallets with `connectAdapter.exportWalletPrivateKey`, passing in the address (of the `EVMConnectAdapter` or `SolanaConnectAdapter` imported/generated wallet) that you'd like to export.

<Note>
<p>This does not refer to importing/exporting wallets within Particle Auth; Particle Network's MPC-TSS accounts do not support importing/exporting private keys.</p>
<p>This is specific to custom account connection with Particle Connect.</p>
</Note>

```kotlin Kotlin
val account = connectAdapter.importWalletFromPrivateKey(privateKey)

val account = connectAdapter.importWalletFromMnemonic(mnemonic)

// Exportation
val privateKey = connectAdapter.exportWalletPrivateKey(address)
```

### Sign and Send Transaction

To initiate a transaction for signature and ultimately settlement on-chain, you'll need to use `connectAdapter.signAndSendTransaction` (for both EVM and Solana). This will return a popup to the adapter in question, prompting a signature from the end user. Once they confirm, the transaction will be immediately sent to the network.

`connectAdapter.signAndSendTransaction` takes the following parameters:

- `address`, the user address to target for transaction initiation.
- `transaction`, a stringified transaction object (containing fields like 'to', 'from', 'value', 'data', etc.).
- `callback`, return handling.

| Field           | Type                | Description                                                  |
| :-------------- | :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `publicAddress` | `String`            | the connected public address, if `adapter` is `AuthCoreAdapter`, you can pass an empty string, for other walletTypes, you need pass a connected public address. |
| `transaction`   | `String`            | evm transaction is expressed as a hexadecimal string, solana transaction is expressed as a base58 string. |
| callback        | TransactionCallback | Callback function, callback different methods according to success or failure |

E.g.:

```kotlin Kotlin
connectAdapter.signAndSendTransaction(address, transaction, callback)
 adapter.signAndSendTransaction(publicAddress = "", transaction = "tx",
            object : TransactionCallback {
                override fun onTransaction(transactionId: String?) {
                  	//success
                }

                override fun onError(error: ConnectError) {
                  //handle error
                }
            })
```

### Sign Transaction

`connectAdapter.signTransaction` is a **Solana-specific** method for signing a transaction without pushing it to the network. Specifically, this method requires the following parameters:

| Field           | Type         | Description                                                  |
| :-------------- | :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `publicAddress` | `String`     | the connected public address, if `adapter` is `AuthCoreAdapter`, you can pass an empty string, for other walletTypes, you need pass a connected public address. |
| `transaction`   | `String`     | evm transaction is expressed as a hexadecimal string, solana transaction is expressed as a base58 string. |
| callback        | SignCallback | Callback function, callback different methods according to success or failure |

E.g.:

```kotlin Kotlin
connectAdapter.signTransaction(address, transaction, callback)

// Alternatively, the plural form of this method, takes a list of transactions
connectAdapter.signAllTransactions(address, transactions, callback)
```

### Sign Message

To sign a basic UTF-8 message (string), you can use `connectAdapter.signMessage` to prompt the user for a signature alongside the message in question. `connectAdapter.signMessage` takes the following parameters:

| Field           | Type         | Description                                                  |
| :-------------- | :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `publicAddress` | `String`     | the connected public address, if `adapter` is `AuthCoreAdapter`, you can pass an empty string, for other walletTypes, you need pass a connected public address. |
| `message`       | `String`     | the message you'd like the user to sign. For EVM, this should be a hex-encoded string (prefixed by '0x'), while for Solana, you can pass in a standard string. |
| callback        | SignCallback | Callback function, callback different methods according to success or failure |

E.g.:

```kotlin Kotlin
connectAdapter.signMessage(address, message, callback)
```

### Sign Typed Data

Alternatively, **for EVM chains**, you can request that a user signs typed (structured) data rather than purely a raw string. To do this, you can use `connectAdapter.signTypedData` (equivalent to `eth_signTypedData`). This takes the following parameters:

| Field           | Type         | Description                                                  |
| :-------------- | :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `publicAddress` | `String`     | the connected public address, if `adapter` is `AuthCoreAdapter`, you can pass an empty string, for other walletTypes, you need pass a connected public address. |
| `data`          | `String`     | the typed data to be signed; see the [Web (JavaScript/TypeScript)](/api-reference/auth/desktop-sdks/web) page for additional guidance. |
| callback        | SignCallback | Callback function, callback different methods according to success or failure |

- `address`, the user address to target for signature initiation.
- `data`, the typed data to be signed; see the [Web (JavaScript/TypeScript)](/api-reference/auth/desktop-sdks/web) page for additional guidance.
- `callback`, return handling.

E.g.:

```kotlin Kotlin
connectAdapter.signTypedData(address, data, callback)
```

## Custom WalletConnect Adapter

There may be cases where the existing selection of adapters doesn't include a wallet you'd like to be featured within Particle Connect. In this situation, creating a custom adapter (using WalletConnect) is quite simple. Doing so will require a structure** similar to the example below**, in which a custom Coin98 adapter is made.

```xml XML
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.connect.demo">
    <queries>
        ...
        <package android:name="coin98.crypto.finance.media" />
    </queries>
    <application>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

```kotlin Kotlin
class Coin98ConnectAdapter : BaseWalletConnectAdapter() {

  val coin98 = MobileWCWallet(name = "Coin98", packageName = "coin98.crypto.finance.media", scheme = "coin98")

  override val name: WalletName = coin98.name

  override val icon: IconUrl = "https://registry.walletconnect.com/v2/logo/md/dee547be-936a-4c92-9e3f-7a2350a62e00"

  override val url: WebsiteUrl = "https://coin98.com"

  override val mobileWallet: MobileWCWallet = coin98

  override val readyState: WalletReadyState
      get() {
          if (supportChains.contains(ConnectManager.chainType)) {
              return if (AppUtils.isAppInstalled(
                      ConnectManager.context, coin98.packageName
                  )
              ) WalletReadyState.Installed else WalletReadyState.NotDetected
          }
          return WalletReadyState.Unsupported
      }
}
```
