## Particle Connect for iOS

The utilization of Particle Connect within iOS applications enables simultaneous Web2-like onboarding and Web3-native onboarding, acting as a sort of "SSO for Web3," aggregating multiple onboarding paths within a single custom, in-house connection modal. These paths include Web3 accounts (social logins), Web3 wallets (through WalletConnect and Solana's `wallet-adapter`), and private key imports. Thus, Particle Connect on iOS aims to facilitate a universally accessible entry into mobile dApps.

Leveraging Particle Connect within your iOS application is relatively straightforward, as **outlined below**.

## Repository

Before diving into the configuration and utilization process, if you'd like to look at our demo repository for an initial understanding of the underlying architecture and implementation flow, the official Particle Connect iOS SDK repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Particle-Network/particle-connect-ios).

<Warning>
It is strongly discouraged to use a private key or the mnemonic import/generate function. If you use it, you need to secure the data yourself, as Particle doesn't have a relationship with the imported/generated mnemonic or private key.
</Warning>

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The setup process on iOS can be somewhat lengthy, so to ensure you don't run into any compatibility issues and can get started as soon as possible, you'll need to confirm that your project meets several different prerequisites:

- **Xcode 15.0** or higher
- **CocoaPods 1.14.3** or higher
- **iOS 14** or higher

### Setting up the Particle dashboard

Additionally, before diving in, you'll need to retrieve three universally required values from the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network): your `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId`. These directly link your project (instance of Particle Connect) with the Particle dashboard to enable customization, analytics, tracking, etc.

<Note>Follow the quickstart tutorial to set up a project and find the required keys: [Create a new project](/guides/wallet-as-a-service/waas/mobile-quickstart#configuring-particle-auth).</Note>

### Dependencies

Particle Connect requires numerous dependencies you must declare within your Podfile. To do this, you'll need to start by ensuring that you have a Podfile made. This is where you'll determine the pods (packages) to be used within your application.

If you don't have a Podfile made, head over to the root of your project directly and run the following:

```shell Terminal
pod init
```

Then, within your Podfile, you'll need to throw in a few different dependencies, the specifics of which depend on the functions of Particle Connect that you'd like to use.

1. Regardless of specific functions, you'll need `ConnectCommon` and `ParticleConnect`, alongside `AuthCoreAdapter`.
2. If you'd like to support importing (or generating fresh) wallets on EVM chains, you'll need `ConnectEVMAdapter`.
   1. To do the same on Solana, you can use `ConnectSolanaAdapter`.
3. To support connection with Phantom (on Solana), you'll need to use `ConnectPhantomAdapter`
4. For general WalletConnect-based connection, you can use `ConnectWalletConnectAdapter`:

```ruby
pod 'ConnectCommon'
pod 'ParticleConnect'
pod 'ConnectWalletConnectAdapter'
pod 'ConnectEVMAdapter' 
pod 'ConnectSolanaAdapter'
pod 'ConnectPhantomAdapter'
pod 'AuthCoreAdapter' 
```

With this set, you can simply run the following command to ensure changes are saved:

```shell Terminal
pod install --repo-update
open your-project.xcworkspace
```

Before continuing, paste the following code into your Podfile, if not already present; this is required for utilizing Particle Connect. You'll encounter issues otherwise.

```ruby
post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
    config.build_settings['BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION'] = 'YES'
      end
    end
end
```

### Configuration

Now that you've retrieved your `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId` from the Particle dashboard, and also set up your Podfile, it's time to move onto the core configuration of your project before diving into examples of utilization. To begin this process, you'll need to configure a `ParticleNetwork-Info.plist` file.

Since it's ikely not already present, head to the root of your project and make a blank file, `ParticleNetwork-Info.plist`

Within this file, you must enter the authentication credentials retrieved from the Particle dashboard. You can do this through the structure below:

```xml XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>PROJECT_UUID</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_UUID</string>
	<key>PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY</string>
	<key>PROJECT_APP_UUID</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_APP_UUID</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Additionally, head over to your `UIApplicationDelegate`. Here, you'll need to import the various libraries previously declared within your Podfile at the top of the file. An example of this can be seen below:

```swift Swift
import ConnectCommon
import ConnectEVMAdapter
import ConnectPhantomAdapter
import ConnectSolanaAdapter
import ConnectWalletConnectAdapter
import ParticleNetworkBase
import ParticleConnect
import AuthCoreAdapter
```

### Initialization

Now that these are set, you'll need to initialize Particle Connect itself (within `UIApplicationDelegate`). Particle Connect won't function until initialization is complete (and valid). Essentially, initialization involves the declaration of specific imported adapters, alongside the chain to be used and application metadata.

Specifically, `ParticleConnect.initialize` takes the following parameters:

| Field  | Type   | Description                                                                                              |
|--------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `env` | `DevEnvironment` | The specific environmennt to be used. This can be either `.debug`, `.staging`, `.production`, this should be set to `.production` when release |    
| `chainInfo` | `ChainInfo` | The primary chain to be used within your application. This should be dictated by an overall blockchain, followed by a specific network (testnet). Within this example, it's `.ethereum`(alternatively it could be `.ethereumSepolia`, and so on.) |  
| `dAppData` | `DAppMetadata` | Metadata outlining the description of your application, This should be an instance of `DAppMetadata` with the following parameters: `name`, the name of your project. `icon`, a URL linking to the icon of your project; this should be 512x512, ideally.  `url`, the URL of your project's website. `description`, the description of your project, `redirectUniversalLink`, optional, redirect universal link of you project, default is `DAppMetadata.standard`.|
| `adapters` | `[ConnectAdapter]` | You'll need to pass in a list of adapters to be offered within the connection modal. This can be defined as a simple array containing various imported adapters (such as `AuthCoreAdapter`, `MetaMaskConnectAdapter`, etc.) |

An **example** of initialization can be found below.

```swift Swift
var adapters: [ConnectAdapter] = [
       AuthCoreAdaper(),
       WalletConnectAdapter(),
       MetaMaskConnectAdapter(),
       PhantomConnectAdapter(),
       EVMConnectAdapter(),
       SolanaConnectAdapter(),
       ImtokenConnectAdapter(),
       BitkeepConnectAdapter(),
       RainbowConnectAdapter(),
       TrustConnectAdapter(),
		   ZerionConnectAdapter(),
       MathConnectAdapter(),
       Inch1ConnectAdapter(),
       ZengoConnectAdapter(),
       AlphaConnectAdapter(),
       OKXConnectAdapter()
       ]
 
ParticleConnect.initialize(env: .debug, chainInfo: .ethereum, dAppData: .standard) {
            adapters
        }
```

### Scheme Configuration

The final step in setting up your iOS project is the configuration of a scheme URL and `LSAApplicationQueriesSchemes` within your application. Beginning with the scheme URL, add the following to your dApp's `application(_:open:options:)` method:

```swift Swift
return ParticleConnect.handleUrl(url)
```

From there, you'll need to configure the scheme URL itself; select your application target within the "Info" section, then add an additional URL type, and finally include the scheme. **This scheme should be `pn` added to your `appId`.**

For example, if your `appId` is `63bfa427-cf5f-4742-9ff1-e8f5a1b9828f`, then the scheme URL would be `pn63bfa427-cf5f-4742-9ff1-e8f5a1b9828f` --simply adding `pn` to the beginning of the `appId`.

With the scheme URL configured, you'll also need to head into `info.plist` and add `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` according to your specific utilization of Web3 wallets (not Particle Auth, but independent wallet adapters). An example of this can be seen below (each of these is optional and dependent upon your given implementation)

```xml XML
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
	<string>metamask</string>
	<string>phantom</string>
	<string>bitkeep</string>
	<string>imtokenv2</string>
	<string>rainbow</string>
	<string>trust</string>
	
	<string>zerion</string>
  <string>mathwallet</string>
  <string>1inch</string>
  <string>awallet</string>
  <string>okex</string>

  <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
  <string>We need access in order to open photos of barcodes</string>
  <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
  <string>We use the camera to scan barcodes</string>
  <key>NSFaceIDUsageDescription</key>
  <string>We use Face ID for secure access to the app.</string>
</array>
```

## Examples of Utilization

### Utilization of WalletConnect V2

If you're planning on using WalletConnect V2 as your primary method of connection for traditional Web3 wallets, you'll need to use the `setWalletConnectV2ProjectId` method on `ParticleConnect`, passing in your WalletConnect project ID retrieved from the [WalletConnect dashboard](https://cloud.walletconnect.com). Additionally, you can set specific chains to be used within WalletConnect (`chainInfo` structures) with `setWalletConnectV2SupportChainInfos`. An example of this can be found below.

```swift Swift
ParticleConnect.setWalletConnectV2ProjectId("WalletConnect V2 Project ID")

ParticleConnect.setWalletConnectV2SupportChainInfos([.ethereum, .polygon])
```

### Get all Wallet Adapter

To retrieve all wallet adapters either in total, by `chainType` (`evm` or `solana`), or by address, you'll need to call one of the following methods:

- `ParticleConnect.getAllAdapters`, returns all adapters (for every address and `chainType`).
- `ParticleConnect.getAdapters`, retrieves adapters by `chainType` (`evm` or `solana`).
- `ParticleConnect.getAdapterByAddress`, returns all adapters associated with a specific (user) public address.

```swift Swift
let adapter = ParticleConnect.getAllAdapters()
            .filter { $0.walletType == .authCore }.first

let adapters = ParticleConnect.getAdapters(chainType: .evm)

let adapters = ParticleConnect.getAdapterByAddress(publicAddress: address)
```

### Get Adapter Accounts

`adapter.getAccounts` returns a list of accounts associated/connected with a specific adapter. `adapter` is an instance of a given wallet adapter, such as `AuthCoreAdapter`. Each adapter has a `getAccounts` method by default. Alternatively, to retrieve smart accounts associated with a given adapter, you'll need to call `adapter.getSmartAccounts`. E.g.:

```swift Swift
let accounts = adapter.getAccounts()

// Alternatively
let smartAccounts = try await adapter.getSmartAccounts()
```

### Switch Chain

Oftentimes, the primary chain initially set through `initialize` won't be the _only_ chain used within your application; thus, to account for this and change the primary chain post-initialization, you can call `ParticleNetwork.setChainInfo`, passing in a `chainInfo` object, as shown in the example below.

`WalletType.authCore` comes from Particle Auth Core, supports evm and solana, if you need switch chain for there two account, and have switch from solana to evm or evm to solana, you can call `(adapter as! ParticleAdapter).switchChain`.

```swift Swift
ParticleNetwork.setChainInfo(.ethereum)

// switch chain asynchronous from evm to solana or solana to evm.
// make sure the adapter.walletType is authCore or particle.
let result = try await (adapter as! ParticleAdapter).switchChain(.ethereum).value
```

### Connect Wallet

Likely one of the most important methods, specific adapters can initiate connection (through an initialization in a variable such as `adapter`) with the `connect` method. Depending on the specific adapter, this method will throw a modal facilitating connection. 

For `EVMConnectAdapter` and `SolanaConnectAdapter`, this will generate a fresh account (public and private key pair). Otherwise, the specific connection flow will be dependent upon the adapter in which `connect` is called. E.g.:

| Field  | Type   | Description                                                                                              |
|--------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `config` | `ConnectConifg?` | The `ConnectConfig` will only be effective when `adapter.walletType` is `.authCore`. You can construct a valid object using the subclass `ParticleAuthCoreConfig`. When `adapter.walletType` is other value, you can pass `ConnectConfig.none`. |

`ParticleAuthCoreConfig` construct method `init` support the following parameters:

| Field  | Type   | Description                                                                                              |
|--------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `loginType` | `LoginType` | The specific social login to be used. This can be either `.email`, `.phone`, `.google`, `.apple`, `.jwt`, `.facebook`, `.twitter`, `.discord`, `.github`, `.twitch`, `.microsoft` or `linkedin`. |
| `supportAuthType` | `[SupportAuthType]` | The methods of authentication visible on the authentication popup UI. By default, this will be exclusive to the chosen social login method, although by passing in additional types, you can expand the UI to include the ability to login with those as an alternative to type. |
| `account` | `String?` | (Optional) when `type` is set to either `.email`, `.phone`, or `.jwt`, you can use the `account` parameter to pass in an expected email, phone number, or JWT. This is optional for the former two, but required for `.jwt`. The phone number must be in E.164 format. |
| `code` | `String?` | (Optional) when `type` is set to either `.email` pr `.phone`, you can use the code parameter to pass the verification code. |
| `socialLoginPrompt` | `SocialLoginPrompt?` | (Optional) either `.none`, `.consent`, or `.select_account` |
| `loginPageConfig` | `LoginPageConfig?`| (Optional) to customize the UI page, contains project name, icon and description. |

```swift Swift

// show connect with metamask
let adapter = ParticleConnect.getAllAdapters().first { $0.walletType == .metaMask }!
let account = try await adapter.connect(ConnectConfig.none).value

// show conenct with particle
let adapter = ParticleConnect.getAllAdapters().first { $0.walletType == .authCore }!
let account = try await adapter.connect(ParticleAuthCoreConfig(loginType: .google, socialLoginPrompt: .selectAccount)).value
```

Only after connect with particle successful, you can retrieve userInfo by call `(adapter as! ParticleAdapter).getUserInfo` method, other walletType cant call this method.

```swift
let userInfo = (adapter as! ParticleAdapter).getUserInfo
```

### Disconnect Wallet

Alternatively, if a user has already connected their wallet, you'll be able to use `disconnect` as the primary method to disconnect a user within an active session. This will be relatively universal across adapters. E.g.:

| Field  | Type   | Description                                                                                              |
|--------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `publicAddress` | `String` | The connected public address, if `adapter.WalletType` is `.authCore`, you can pass an empty string, for other walletTypes, you need pass a connected public address. |


```swift Swift
let result = try await adapter.disconnect(address).value
```


### Is Connected

Another quite important method is `isConnected`, returning a Boolean based on whether or not a given session (user) is currently connected to a wallet (through the specific adapter instance). `adapter.isConnected` takes a given public address and returns `true` or `false` depending on it's connection status. E.g.:

| Field  | Type   | Description                                                                                              |
|--------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `publicAddress` | `String` | The connected public address, if `adapter.WalletType` is `.authCore`, you can pass an empty string, for other walletTypes, you need pass a connected public address. |

```swift Swift
let result = adapter.isConnected(publicAddress: address)
```

### Import Wallet

If you're using `EVMConnectAdapter` or `SolanaConnectAdapter`, you can import wallets through either a seed phrase or private key. These methods will associate an account instance derived from these keys, allowing utilization within your application. These can be achieved through either `importWalletFromPrivateKey` for importing a private key, or `importWalletFromMnemonic` for importing a mnemonic (seed phrase).

Additionally, you can export one of these wallets with `adapter.exportWalletPrivateKey`, passing in the address (of the `EVMConnectAdapter` or `SolanaConnectAdapter` imported/generated wallet) that you'd like to export.

<Note>
<p>This is not the import/export of wallets within Particle Auth; Particle Network's MPC-TSS accounts do not support importing or exporting private keys.</p>
<p>This is specific to custom account connection with Particle Connect.</p>
</Note>

```swift Swift
let account = try await adapter.importWalletFromPrivateKey(privateKey).value

let account = try await adapter.importWalletFromMnemonic(mnemonic).value

// Exportation
let privateKey = try await adapter.exportWalletPrivateKey(publicAddress: address).value
```

### Sign and Send Transaction

To initiate a transaction for signature and ultimately settlement on-chain, you'll need to use `adapter.signAndSendTransaction` (for both EVM & Solana)- this acts as the primary method of sending transactions through Particle Connect. Calling this method will return a popup to the adapter in question, prompting a signature from the end user. Once confirmation is given, the transaction will be immediately sent to the network.

`adapter.signAndSendTransaction` takes the following parameters:

| Field  | Type   | Description                                                                                              |
|--------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `publicAddress` | `String` | The connected public address, if `adapter.WalletType` is `.authCore`, you can pass an empty string, for other walletTypes, you need pass a connected public address. |
| `transaction` | `String` | Evm transaction is expressed as a hexadecimal string, solana transaction is expressed as a base58 string. |

```swift Swift
let txHash = try await adapter.signAndSendTransaction(publicAddress: address, transaction: transaction).value
```

You can create en EVM transaction with class `TxData` or `FeeMarketEIP1559TxData`, also you can use another SDK `ParticleWalletAPI` to create transaction, you can reference the examples from [Wallet SDK reference](/api-reference/wallet/mobile/ios.mdx#create-transaction)


### Sign Transaction

`adapter.signTransaction` is a **Solana-specific** method for signing a transaction without pushing it to the network. Specifically, this method requires the following parameters:

| Field  | Type   | Description                                                                                              |
|--------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `publicAddress` | `String` | The connected public address, if `adapter.WalletType` is `.authCore`, you can pass an empty string, for other walletTypes, you need pass a connected public address. |
| `transaction` | `String` | A base58 string representing a transaction object. |

This will return a popup requesting confirmation to either `SolanaConnectAdapter` or `PhantomConnectAdapter` depending on which you've defined as `adapter` (or, alternatively, a custom adapter you've set up). E.g.:

```swift Swift
let signed = try await adapter.signTransaction(publicAddress: address, transaction: transaction).value

// Alternatively, the plural form of this method, takes a list of transactions
let signeds = try await adapter.signAllTransactions(publicAddress: address, transactions: transactions).value
```

### Sign Message (EIP191)

To sign a basic UTF-8 message (string), you can use `adapter.signMessage` to prompt the user for a signature, alongside the message in question. `adapter.signMessage` takes the following parameters:

| Field  | Type   | Description                                                                                              |
|--------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `publicAddress` | `String` | The connected public address, if `adapter.WalletType` is `.authCore`, you can pass an empty string, for other walletTypes, you need pass a connected public address. |
| `message` | `String` | The message you'd like the user to sign; for EVM, this should be a hex-encoded string (prefixed by '0x'), while for Solana, you can pass in a standard string (no encoding needed). |


```swift Swift
let signed = try await adapter.signMessage(publicAddress: address, message: message).value
```

### Sign Typed Data V4 (EIP712)

As an alternative to `signMessage`, for **EVM chains**, you can request that a user signs typed (structured) data rather than purely a raw string. To do this, you can use `adapter.signTypedData` (equivalent to `eth_signTypedData` V4). This takes the following parameters:

| Field  | Type   | Description                                                                                              |
|--------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `publicAddress` | `String` | The connected public address, if `adapter.WalletType` is `.authCore`, you can pass an empty string, for other walletTypes, you need pass a connected public address. |
| `data` | `String` | The typed data to be signed; see the [Web (JavaScript/TypeScript)](/api-reference/auth/desktop-sdks/web) page for additional guidance. |


```swift Swift
let signed = try await adapter.signTypedData(publicAddress: publicAddress, data: message).value
```

### Custom WalletConnect Adapter

There may be cases where the existing selection of adapters doesn't include a wallet you'd like to be featured within Particle Connect. In this situation, creating a custom adapter (using `WalletConnectAdapter` as the parent class) is quite simple. Doing so will require a structure similar to the example below, in which a custom Coin98 adapter is made by overriding `walletType` with a custom `AdapterInfo` instance.

```swift Swift
public class Coin98WalletConnectAdapter: WalletConnectAdapter {
  public override var walletType: WalletType {
      return WalletType.custom(info: AdapterInfo.init(name: "Coin98",
                   url: "https://coin98.com/",
                   icon: "https://registry.walletconnect.com/v2/logo/md/dee547be-936a-4c92-9e3f-7a2350a62e00",
                   redirectUrlHost: "coin98",
                   supportChains: [.evm],
                   deepLink: "coin98://", // Requires either universal link or scheme
                   scheme: "coin98://"))
  }
}
```

## Dive Deeper

`ParticleConnect` includes `ParticleAuthCore`. If you log in with a Particle account, you can access additional function such as `getUserInfo`, `openAccountAndSecurity`, `hasMasterPassword` and `hasPaymentPassword` and `changeMasterPassword`, you can reference the docs from [Auth SDK reference](/api-reference/auth/mobile-sdks/ios)
