# Universally accessible, customized onboarding

Particle Connect offers a unified mechanism for facilitating dApp connection through Web2 (Particle Auth) and Web3 (WalletConnect, Solana's `wallet-adapter`, and private key imports) logins. This fundamentally lowers the initial entry barrier within decentralized applications, offering an onboarding path for every different archetype of a user, from Web3 natives to traditional Web2 consumers.

Available as a collection of SDKs and modules on virtually every major platform, Particle Connect is the all-in-one connection layer for your application.
