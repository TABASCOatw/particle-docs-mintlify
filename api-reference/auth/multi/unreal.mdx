## Particle Auth for Unreal Engine

Extending beyond directly programmatic implementations, Particle Auth also features full support for Unreal Engine 5 through a no-code interface, enabling the integration of Particle's Wallet-as-a-Service in a familiar and straightforward environment when building games on Unreal Engine.

***

## Getting Started

Getting started with the Particle Auth Unreal Engine SDK is simple, although it requires you to manually download and use the [`particle-unreal` GitHub repository](https://github.com/Particle-Network/particle-unreal) to install the SDK. 

To install:

1. Open your project's root directly (you'll find your `.uproject` file here).
2. Create a new directory, `Plugins`, or skip this step if `Plugins` already exists.
3. Navigate to [`Plugins/ParticleSDK` within `particle-unreal`](https://github.com/Particle-Network/particle-unreal/tree/main/Plugins) and copy it to your `Plugins` folder.
4. Open the Unreal Engine 5 editor, then head over to `Menu`, then `Edit`, and finally `Plugins`, in which you'll find an option to enable `ParticleSDK`.

## Examples of utilization

### Initialization

To begin, you'll need to create a config object with your `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId` filled in.

<Note>Follow the quickstart tutorial to set up a project and find the required keys: [Create a new project](/guides/wallet-as-a-service/waas/mobile-quickstart#configuring-particle-auth).</Note>

With these retrieved and set, you'll need to call the `Init` function for formal initialization. The `Init` function takes the following parameters:

- `Default Browser Widget`. Generally, this can be set to `W_ExecuteWebBrowser`, although if you'd like to use a custom `WebBrowser` blueprint, you can use that instead (it must follow the structure of `W_ExecuteWebBrowser`).
- `In Config`, which links back to the previously defined config object containing `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId`.
- `In Theme`, an optional JSON string containing customization configuration. See [Particle Auth Set Auth Theme](/api-reference/auth/desktop-sdks/web#usecustomize) for more information.
- `In Language`, the language used within the modal, either `en`, `zh-cn`, `zh-tw`, `ja`, or `ko`.
- `In Chain Name` & `In Chain Id`; the primary chain to be used, either EVM or Solana. For more information on specific chainId and chainName configurations, see [EVM Chains Structure](/guides/network-coverage).

### Login

`Login` is the primary facilitator of onboarding and account creation/sign in within Particle Auth. On Unreal Engine, social logins can be accessed through the included `Login` function, containing the following parameters:

- `Preferred Auth Type`, an optional field dictating the specific authentication type to be used. This should be either:
  - `phone`, for phone-based logins (sends a text message for verification and ties an account to a user's phone number).
  - `email`, for email-based login (sends a verification email and ties an account to a user email address).
  - `jwt`, for custom authentication (leveraging JWTs for external, custom authentication).
- `Account`, another optional field for passing expected values for an email address, phone number, or JWT.

Upon successful login, a JSON string containing detailed user info (email or phone, addresses, UUID, token, etc.) will be returned as event data.

### Sign Message

For the prompting of a standard message signature (general strings, not typed data), you can use the `SignMessage` blueprint, which displays a signature request for the end-user to confirm. `SignMessage` contains the following parameters:

- `Message`, the message to be signed by the user. For EVM chains, this can be passed as a standard UTF-8 string, although for Solana, this should be a base58 string.

Upon successful confirmation, the signature will be returned in event data via `OnSignMessageEvent`.

### Sign and Send Transaction

`SignAndSendTransaction` acts as the foundational method for sending transactions on EVM and Solana. Upon calling, a transaction will be thrown and displayed to an end-user, in which they can either confirm a signature and push the transaction to the network or reject it and cancel the operation. The `SignAndSendTransaction` blueprint takes the following parameters:

- `Transaction`, this should be a string (standard UTF-8 for EVM, base58 for Solana) representing a transaction object/structure to be sent (can be a stringified object).

Additionally, you can use `MakeEvmTransaction`, a helper method that can be attached to `Transaction` on  `SignAndSendTransaction` for no-code generation of an EVM transaction.

Upon a successful signature, `OnSignAndSendTransactionEvent` will include event data with the signature present.

### Sign Typed Data

On EVM chains, as an alternative to `SignMessage`, you can use `SignTypedData` to prompt a signature of structured (typed) data. The `SignTypedData` blueprint takes the following parameters:

- `Message`, the message (or data in this case) to be prompted for signature. This should be a standard JSON string containing a data structure.
- `Version`, Particle Auth supports all three versions of `eth_signTypedData`; `v1`, `v3`, and `v4`. By default, `v4` is used.

Upon confirmation, `OnSignTypedDataEvent` will return the signature in question.

### Sign Transaction

`SignTransaction` is a **Solana-specific** method for signing (and thus returning a signature for) a given transaction without pushing it to the network. The `SignTransaction` blueprint takes the following parameter:

- `Transaction`, this should be a base58 string representing a valid transaction structure to be prompted for signature.

Upon a successful signature, `OnSignTransactionEvent` will return the completed signature in question.

### Sign All Transactions

The plural of the former, `SignAllTransactions` is another **Solana-specific** method for collectively signing transactions without pushing them to the network. The `SignAllTransactions` blueprint takes the following parameter:

- `Transactions`, this should be an array of base58 strings, each representing a valid transaction to be included and prompted for signature.

After this function concludes and signatures are generated, `OnSignAllTransactionsEvent` will return them.
